# Django-Stock-Screener

This is a basic stock screener application. It uses Python and the Django framework, with some HTML and CSS. This application was built as an educational exercise.

The user can input a stock by its ticker symbol, and then receive data fetched from the Alpha Vantage free tier API. The app includes some error handling if a user enters an incorrect stock symbol.
